Gotcha — “Invalid image source” means the Markdown is pointing to a path your renderer can’t fetch. The SVG itself is fine; the link is what’s broken.

Here’s how to make it work in the three common contexts, plus a PNG fallback.

### 1) GitHub README (in the repo)

Put the file at exactly this path in your repo (case-sensitive):

```
assets/diagrams/provenance.svg
```

Then embed with a **relative** path (no leading slash):

```md
![Provenance](assets/diagrams/provenance.svg)
```

If you’re on a branch other than `main`, GitHub’s relative path still resolves correctly.

### 2) GitHub issue / PR comment (needs absolute “raw” URL)

Use the “raw” URL form:

```md
![Provenance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<org>/<repo>/<branch>/assets/diagrams/provenance.svg)
```

### 3) MkDocs / GitHub Pages

If `docs/` is your site root, place the asset under `docs/assets/diagrams/` or set `mkdocs.yml`:

```yaml
docs_dir: docs
extra_css:
  - assets/css/site.css
```

Then embed:

```md
![Provenance](/assets/diagrams/provenance.svg)
```

(Leading slash is correct for site-rooted MkDocs URLs.)

### 4) Kaggle Markdown cell

Kaggle cannot fetch private GitHub files with relative repo paths. Either:

* Upload the SVG to the Kaggle notebook as a dataset/file and reference with a notebook-local path, or
* Use an **absolute** raw GitHub URL (public repo only).

### Files I’ve produced for you (download and commit)

* SVG (responsive): [assets/diagrams/provenance.svg](sandbox:/mnt/data/assets/diagrams/provenance.svg)
* DOT (debuggable source): [assets/diagrams/provenance.dot](sandbox:/mnt/data/assets/diagrams/provenance.dot)
* Secondary SVG name (some static site toolchains prefer no mutations): [assets/diagrams/provenance.static.svg](sandbox:/mnt/data/assets/diagrams/provenance.static.svg)
* PNG fallback: [assets/diagrams/provenance\_for\_png.png](sandbox:/mnt/data/assets/diagrams/provenance_for_png.png)

### Commit snippet

```bash
# from repo root
mkdir -p assets/diagrams
cp /mnt/data/assets/diagrams/provenance.svg assets/diagrams/provenance.svg
cp /mnt/data/assets/diagrams/provenance_for_png.png assets/diagrams/provenance.png
git add assets/diagrams/provenance.svg assets/diagrams/provenance.png
git commit -m "docs(diagrams): add provenance graph (SVG + PNG fallback)"
```

### Quick checks if it still errors

* ✅ Path exists on that branch/commit (open the file directly in GitHub to verify).
* ✅ No leading `/` in README image paths (use relative).
* ✅ Case matches exactly (`Assets/` ≠ `assets/`).
* ✅ For issues/PRs/Kaggle, use absolute “raw” URL or upload the asset.

If you want, I can also embed clickable links inside the SVG (nodes → repo files/ADRs) so the diagram doubles as navigation.
