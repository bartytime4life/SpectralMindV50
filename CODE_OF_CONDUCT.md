We are committed to:

* Respectful collaboration across disciplines (ML, astrophysics, software engineering).
* Maintaining **reproducibility and transparency** in all contributions.
* Protecting the fairness and credibility of the **NeurIPS 2025 Ariel Data Challenge**.
* Upholding **NASA-grade engineering standards** for safety, security, and auditability.

## üí° Our Standards

### Positive behaviors include:

* Writing clear, tested, and reproducible code.
* Respecting the ADR process for non-trivial design changes.
* Providing constructive, respectful feedback in PRs and reviews.
* Citing sources, prior work, and relevant literature.
* Helping others succeed in local, CI, and Kaggle environments.
* Ensuring models obey scientific and physical plausibility (smoothness, non-negativity, FGS1 prioritization).

### Unacceptable behaviors include:

* Harassment, trolling, or personal attacks.
* Plagiarizing or submitting others‚Äô work as your own.
* Inserting insecure code, secrets, backdoors, or exfiltration logic.
* Subverting reproducibility (e.g., hidden configs, hardcoded paths, non-deterministic hacks).
* Breaking competition rules (e.g., exfiltrating Kaggle data, collusion, leaking test labels).
* Misrepresenting results or fabricating performance in publications or reports.
