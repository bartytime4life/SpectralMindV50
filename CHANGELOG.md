[Unreleased]

üöÄ Added
	‚Ä¢	JSON Schemas:
	‚Ä¢	schemas/submission.tableschema.sample_id.json ‚Äî Tableschema with sample_id as canonical key; stricter enums/patterns and full worked examples.
	‚Ä¢	Integration tests:
	‚Ä¢	tests/integration/test_calib_chain.py.
	‚Ä¢	tests/integration/test_end_to_end_cli.py.
	‚Ä¢	Kaggle assets:
	‚Ä¢	kaggle/README.md, pinned requirements-kaggle.txt, and notebook templates wired to CLI (spectramind.py).
	‚Ä¢	Docs: expanded calibration internals in src/spectramind/calib/, pipeline diagrams in assets/diagrams/, and repo conventions in docs/.
	‚Ä¢	Diagnostics:
	‚Ä¢	FFT/UMAP analysis in src/spectramind/diagnostics/spectral_analysis.py and src/spectramind/diagnostics/dimensionality.py ‚Äî see ADR 0004 Dual Encoder Fusion.
	‚Ä¢	Physics-informed checks in src/spectramind/validators/physics.py ‚Äî see ADR 0002 Physics-Informed Losses.
	‚Ä¢	Unified HTML/JSONL report generator src/spectramind/diagnostics/report.py ‚Äî see ADR 0002 + ADR 0004.
	‚Ä¢	ADC quick-look: src/spectramind/diagnostics/adc_diag.py ‚Äî see ADR 0002.

üîÑ Changed
	‚Ä¢	Trace modeling (src/spectramind/calib/trace.py): multi-order ready center/width, NaN-safe math, stable denominators, background models (column_median, row_poly), Torch-first execution.
	‚Ä¢	Photometry (src/spectramind/calib/photometry.py): batch-aware [..., T, H, W], adaptive apertures, PSF-weighted optimal extraction with variance propagation, full NaN safety.
	‚Ä¢	CI workflows: .github/workflows/ hardened with matrix pinning, cache keys, deterministic pytest.
	‚Ä¢	Pre-commit stack: .pre-commit-config.yaml updated (ruff/black/isort/mypy/bandit/secrets).
	‚Ä¢	Schemas: tightened submission.schema.json + events.schema.json; added drift tests.
	‚Ä¢	Diagnostics reporting (diagnostics/report.py): improved JSON/HTML generator (inline CSS, title support, deterministic UTF-8) ‚Äî see ADR 0002.

üõ†Ô∏è Fixed
	‚Ä¢	Time-axis normalization and mask/variance alignment across calibration modules (src/spectramind/calib/*).
	‚Ä¢	PSF normalization edge cases in photometry.py.
	‚Ä¢	Docstring mismatches and dtype inconsistencies (Torch vs NumPy).
	‚Ä¢	ADC calibration diagnostics clamped NaN/Inf + guarded matplotlib fallback (adc_diag.py) ‚Äî see ADR 0002.

üß™ Performance
	‚Ä¢	Vectorized photometry loops & reduced tensor allocations (photometry.py).
	‚Ä¢	NumPy fallback only for polyfit; Torch-first everywhere else (trace.py).
	‚Ä¢	FFT analysis normalized per-sample, NaN-safe, batch-aware (spectral_analysis.py) ‚Äî see ADR 0004.

üîí Security
	‚Ä¢	All new diagnostics modules passed Bandit + CodeQL scanning (ci.yml).

‚ö†Ô∏è Deprecated
	‚Ä¢	None.

‚ùå Removed
	‚Ä¢	None.
