Hereâ€™s a **CHANGELOG.md** scaffold for your repo that follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) conventions and semantic versioning. I aligned it with your SpectraMind V50 workflow (VERSION file, pyproject.toml, ADR governance).

Would you like me to also add a **GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)** that automatically:

1. Reads `VERSION`
2. Updates CHANGELOG on tag
3. Publishes release notes with artifacts (Docker, Kaggle submission package)?
