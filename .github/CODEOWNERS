# Failsafe default: route everything to a valid user until teams are ready.
# Replace @your-username with a real GitHub user who has write access.

*                                   @your-username

# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# When you're ready to use teams, replace @your-username with org-scoped team
# slugs like @your-org/ml-team (the *team slug*, as seen in the URL), and make
# sure those teams have at least write access to this repo.
#
# Example structure (uncomment after your teams exist and have access):

# src/spectramind/models/           @your-org/ml-team
